He served as [[Prime Minister of Vietnam]] from 1945 to 1955, and as [[President of Vietnam]] from 1945 until his death in 1969. Ideologically a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]], he was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Chairman and First Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Vietnam]].{{Efn|Predecessor of the current [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]}}\n\n{{lang|vi|Hồ Chí Minh|italic=no}} was born in [[Nghệ An province]] in the [[French protectorate of Annam]]. From 1911, he left [[French Indochina]] to continue his revolutionary activities. He was also one of the founding members of the [[French Communist Party]]. In 1930, he founded the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and in 1941, he returned to Vietnam and founded the {{lang|vi|[[Viet Minh|Việt Minh]]|italic=no}} independence movement, an [[Umbrella organization|umbrella group]]. Then, {{lang|vi|Hồ|italic=no}} led the [[August Revolution]] against the Japanese in August 1945, which resulted in the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|independence]] of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. After the French returned to power the following month, Hồ's government retreated to the [[Việt Bắc]] region and began [[guerrilla warfare]]. The Việt Minh defeated the [[French Union]] in 1954 at the [[Battle of Điện Biên Phủ|Battle of {{lang|vi|Điện Biên Phủ|italic=no|nocat=y}}]], ending the [[First Indochina War]], and resulting in the [[1954 Geneva Conference|division of Vietnam]], with the Việt Minh in control of North Vietnam, and anti-communists in control of [[South Vietnam]]. He was a key figure in the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and the {{lang|vi|[[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]]|italic=no}} during the [[Vietnam War]], which lasted from 1955 to 1975. Hồ officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems and died in 1969. North Vietnam was ultimately [[Fall of Saigon|victorious]] against South Vietnam and its [[United States in the Vietnam War|allies]]. [[Vietnam]] was officially [[Reunification Day|unified]] in 1976. Saigon, the former capital of South Vietnam, was renamed [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in his honor.\n\nThe details of {{lang|vi|Hồ Chí Minh|italic=no}}'s life before he came to power in Vietnam are uncertain. He is known to have used between 50<ref name=\"Duiker\">Duiker, William J. ''Ho Chi Minh: A Life''. New York: Hyperion, 2000. <!-- ISBN ?? --></ref>{{rp|582}} and 200 pseudonyms.{{sfn|Duncanson|1957|p=85}} Information on his birth and early life is ambiguous and subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places, and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely.{{sfn|Pike|1976}}\n\nAside from being a politician, Hồ was a writer, poet, and journalist. He wrote several books, articles, and poems in Chinese, Vietnamese, and French.\n\n==Early life==\nHồ Chí Minh was born as Nguyễn Sinh Cung<ref name=\"BBC2005\"/>{{efn|name=\"HL1\"}}<ref name=\"HL2\"/> in 1890 in the village of Làng Chùa or [[Hoàng Trù]] in [[Kim Liên, Nghệ An|Kim Liên]] commune, [[Nam Đàn|Nam Đàn]] district, [[Nghệ An]] province, in [[Central Vietnam]] which was then a [[Annam (French protectorate)|French protectorate]]. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years:{{sfn|Trần Dân Tiên|1994|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2021}} 1891,<ref>Yen Son. \"Nguyen Ai Quoc, the Brilliant Champion of the Revolution.\" Thuong Tin Hanoi. 30 August 1945.</ref> 1892,{{efn|In his application to the French Colonial School – \"Nguyen Tat Thanh, born 1892 at Vinh, son of Mr. Nguyen Sinh Huy (sub doctor in literature)\"}} 1894{{efn|He told Paris Police (Surete) he was born 15 January 1894.}} and 1895.<ref>Ton That Thien 18, 1890 is the most likely year of his birth. There is troubling conflicting evidence, however. When he was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931, he attested in court documents that he was 36. The passport he used to enter Russia in 1921 also gave the year 1895 as his birth date. His application to the Colonial School in Paris gave his birth year as 1892</ref> He lived in his father [[Nguyễn Sinh Sắc]]'s village of Làng Sen in Kim Liên until 1895 when his father sent him to [[Huế]] for study. He had three siblings: his sister Bạch Liên (Nguyễn Thị Thanh), a clerk in the [[French Army]]; his brother [[Nguyễn Sinh Khiêm]] (Nguyễn Tất Đạt), a [[geomancy|geomancer]] and [[Traditional Chinese herbs|traditional herbalist]]; and another brother (Nguyễn Sinh Nhuận), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Hồ) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. He quickly mastered [[Chữ Hán]], a prerequisite for any serious study of [[Confucianism]] while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing.<ref name=\"Duiker\"/>{{rp|21}} In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly [[kite]]s and go fishing.<ref name=\"Duiker\"/>{{rp|21}} Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name at the age of 10: ''Nguyễn Tất Thành.''\n\nHis father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe ([[Qui Nhơn]]). He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the [[Caning|cane]] as punishment for an infraction.<ref name=\"Duiker\" />{{rp|21}} His father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy, but he refused because it meant serving the French.{{sfn|Hunt|2016|p=125}} This exposed Thành (Hồ) to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province. Nevertheless, he received a French education, attending ''[[Quốc Học – Huế High School for the Gifted|Collège Quốc học]]'' (''[[lycée]]'' or secondary education) in Huế in Central Vietnam. His disciples, [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] and [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], also attended the school, as did [[Ngô Đình Diệm]], the future President of South Vietnam and political rival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nguoi-viet.com/viet-nam/hang-tram-nguoi-cong-khai-lam-le-gio-tt-ngo-dinh-diem/|title=Ngo Dinh Diem and ho Chi Minh|date=3 November 2018|publisher=nguoiviet.com}}</ref>\n\nHis early life is uncertain but there are some documents indicating activities regarding an early revolutionary spirit during French-occupied Vietnam, but conflicting sources remain. Previously, it was believed that Thành (Hồ) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-''[[corvée]]'') demonstration of poor peasants in Huế in May 1908, which endangered his student status at ''Collège Quốc học''. However, a document from the [[Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer|Centre des archives d'Outre-mer]] in France shows that he was admitted to ''Collège Quốc học'' on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-''corvée'' demonstration (9–13 April 1908).{{efn|name=\"HL1\"}}\n\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at Dục Thanh school in [[Phan Thiết]] for about six months, then traveled to [[Saigon]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Overseas sojourn==\n===In France===\n[[File: Ho Chi Minh Plaque (6887120535).jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque in Haymarket in London]]\nIn Saigon, he applied to work as a kitchen helper on a French merchant steamer, the ''Amiral de Latouche-Tréville'', using the alias Văn Ba. The ship departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in [[Marseille]], [[French Third Republic|France]] on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for [[Le Havre]] and [[Dunkirk]], returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the ''French Colonial Administrative School'', but his application was rejected. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visiting many countries from 1911 to 1917.{{sfn|Tucker|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2021}}\n\n===In the United States===\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Thành (Hồ) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City ([[Harlem]]) and [[Boston]], where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the [[Omni Parker House|Parker House Hotel]]. The only evidence that he was in the United States is a letter to French colonial administrators dated 15 December 1912 and postmarked New York City (he gave his address as the [[poste restante]] in Le Havre and his occupation as a sailor){{sfn|Quinn-Judge|2002|p=20}} and a postcard to [[Phan Chu Trinh]] in Paris where he mentioned working at the Parker House Hotel.

In 1959, Hồ Chí Minh began urging the Politburo to send aid to the [[Việt Cộng]] in South Vietnam; a \"people's war\" on the South was approved at a session in January 1959, and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March.{{sfn|Ang|2002|p=55–58, 76}}<ref name=\"HistPlace\">{{cite web |title= The History Place&nbsp;– Vietnam War 1945–1960 |url= http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/vietnam/index-1945.html |access-date = 21 December 2017}}</ref> North Vietnam [[North Vietnamese invasion of Laos|invaded]] Laos in July 1959 aided by the [[Pathet Lao]] and used 30,000 men to build a network of supply and reinforcement routes running through Laos and Cambodia that became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Hồ Chí Minh trail]].<ref>''The Economist'', 26 February 1983.</ref> It allowed the North to send manpower and material to the Việt Cộng with much less exposure to South Vietnamese forces, achieving a considerable advantage.<ref>Lind, 1999</ref> To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Việt Cộng was stressed in communist propaganda. North Vietnam created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 as a \"[[united front]]\", or political branch of the Viet Cong intended to encourage the participation of non-Communists. {{sfn|Ang|2002|p=55–58, 76}}<ref name=\" HistPlace\"/>\n\nAt the end of 1959, conscious that the national election would never be held and that Diem intended to purge opposing forces (mostly ex Việt Minh) from the South Vietnamese society, Hồ Chí Minh informally chose [[Lê Duẩn]] to become the next party leader. This was interpreted by Western analysts as a loss of influence for Hồ, who was said to have preferred the more moderate Võ Nguyên Giáp for the position.{{sfn|Ang|2002|p=21}} From 1959 onward, the elderly Hồ became increasingly worried about the prospect of his death, and that year he wrote down his will.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=550}} Lê Duẩn was officially named party leader in 1960, leaving Hồ to function in a secondary role as head of state and member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Politburo]]. He nevertheless maintained considerable influence in the government. Lê Duẩn, [[Tố Hữu]], [[Trường Chinh]] and Phạm Văn Đồng often shared dinner with Hồ, and all of them remained key figures throughout and after the war. In the early 1960s, the North Vietnamese Politburo was divided into the \"North first\" faction who favored focusing on the economic development of North Vietnam, and the \"South first\" faction, who favored a guerrilla war in South Vietnam to reunite Vietnam shortly.{{sfn|Nguyen|2012|p=62}} Between 1961 and 1963, 40,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated into South Vietnam from the North.{{sfn|Ang|2002|p=55–58, 76}}\n\nIn 1963, Hồ purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Diem in hopes of achieving a negotiated peace.{{sfn|Brocheux|2007|p=174}} During the so-called \"Maneli Affair\" of 1963, a French diplomatic initiative was launched to achieve a federation of the two Vietnams, which would be neutral in the Cold War.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=291}} The four principal diplomats involved in the \"Maneli affair\" were [[Ramchundur Goburdhun]], the Indian Chief Commissioner of the ICC; [[Mieczysław Maneli]], the Polish Commissioner to the ICC; Roger Lalouette, the French ambassador to South Vietnam; and Giovanni d'Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=291}} Maneli reported that Hồ was very interested in the signs of a split between President Diem and President Kennedy and that his attitude was: \"Our real enemies are the Americans. Get rid of them, and we can cope with Diem and Nhu afterward\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=291}} Hồ also told Maneli about the Ho Minh Chi Trail, which passed through officially neutral Cambodia and Laos, saying \"Indochina is just one single entity\".{{sfn|Brocheux|2007|p=237}}\n\nAt a meeting in Hanoi held in French, Hồ told Goburdhun that Diem was \"in his way a patriot\", noting that Diem had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time Goburdhun met Diem \"shake hands with him for me\".{{sfn|Jacobs|2006|p=165}} The North Vietnamese Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, speaking on behalf of Hồ, told Maneli he was interested in the peace plan, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam \"we can agree with any Vietnamese\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=292}} On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], the younger brother and right-hand man to Diem to discuss the French peace plan.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=233-234}} It remains unclear if the Ngo brothers were serious about the French peace plan or were merely using the possibility of accepting it to blackmail the United States into supporting them at a time when the Buddhist crisis had seriously strained relations between Saigon and Washington.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=292}} Supporting the latter theory is the fact that Nhu promptly leaked his meeting with Maneli to the American columnist [[Joseph Alsop]], who publicized it in a column entitled \"Very Ugly Stuff\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=292}} The possibility that the Ngo brothers might accept the peace plan contributed to the Kennedy administration's plan to support a coup against them. On 1 November 1963, [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|a coup]] overthrew Diem, who was killed the next day together with his brother. {{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=292}}\n\nDiem had followed a policy of \"deconstructing the state\" by creating several overlapping agencies and departments who were encouraged to feud with one another to disorganize the South Vietnamese state to such an extent that he hoped that it would make a coup against him impossible.{{sfn| Shafer|1988|p=255}} When Diem was overthrown and killed, without any kind of arbiter between the rival arms of the South Vietnamese state, South Vietnam promptly disintegrated.{{sfn|Shafer|1988|p=271-273}} The American Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] reported after visiting South Vietnam in December 1963 that \"there is no organized government worthy of the name\" in Saigon.{{sfn| Shafer|1988|p=271}} At a meeting of the plenum of the Politburo in December 1963, Lê Duẩn's \"South first\" faction triumphed with the Politburo passing a resolution calling for North Vietnam to complete the overthrow of the regime in Saigon as soon as possible while the members of the \"North first\" faction were dismissed.{{sfn|Gaiduk|2003|p=203}} As South Vietnam descended into chaos, whatever interest Hồ might have had in the French peace plan ended, as it become clear the Viet Cong could overthrow the government in Saigon. A CIA report from 1964 stated the factionalism in South Vietnam had reached \"almost the point of anarchy\" as various South Vietnamese leaders fought one another, making any sort of effort against the Viet Cong impossible, which was rapidly taking over much of the South Vietnamese countryside.{{sfn|Shafer|1988|p=272}}\n\nAs South Vietnam collapsed into factionalism and in-fighting while the Viet Cong continued to win the war, it became increasingly apparent to President Lyndon Johnson that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340-342}} Though Johnson did not wish to commit American forces until he had won the 1964 election, he decided to make his intentions clear to Hanoi. In June 1964, the \"Seaborn Mission\" began as [[J. Blair Seaborn]], the Canadian commissioner to the ICC, arrived in Hanoi with a message from Johnson offering billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition in exchange for which North Vietnam would cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=348}} Seaborn also warned that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing, saying that Johnson was seriously considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Hunt|1993|p=15}} Little came of the backchannel of the \"Seaborn Mission\" as the North Vietnamese distrusted Seaborn, who pointedly was never allowed to meet Hồ. {{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=290}}\n\nIn late 1964, People's Army of Vietnam combat troops were sent southwest into officially neutral [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].<ref>Davidson, ''Vietnam at War: the history, 1946–1975'', 1988{{page needed|date=May 2021}}</ref> By March 1965, American combat troops began arriving in South Vietnam, first to protect the airbases around [[Chu Lai]] and [[Da Nang]], later to take on most of the fight as \"[m]ore and more American troops were put in to replace Saigon troops who could not, or would not, get involved in the fighting\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vvaw.org/about/warhistory.php|title=Vietnam Veterans Against the War: History of the U.S. War in Vietnam|work=vvaw.org}}</ref> As fighting escalated, widespread aerial and artillery bombardment all over North Vietnam by the United States Air Force and Navy began with [[Operation Rolling Thunder]].

The American military presence forced the PAVN to expend the majority of their resources on maintaining the Hồ Chí Minh trail rather than reinforcing their comrades' ranks in the South. Hồ seems to have agreed to Thanh's offensive because he wanted to see Vietnam reunified within his lifetime, and the increasingly ailing Hồ was painfully aware that he did not have much time left.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=535}} With Hồ's permission, the Việt Cộng planned a massive [[Tet Offensive]] that would commence on 31 January 1968, to take much of the South by force and deal a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Việt Cộng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of North Vietnam and the Hồ Chí Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, Hồ Chí Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of not using conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to the eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms, materialized.\n\nIn early 1969, Hồ suffered a heart attack and was in increasingly bad health for the rest of the year.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=597}} In July 1969, [[Jean Sainteny]], a former French official in Vietnam who knew Hồ secretly relayed a letter written to him from President Richard Nixon.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=597}} Nixon's letter proposed working together to end this \"tragic war\", but also warned that if North Vietnam made no concessions at the peace talks in Paris by 1 November, Nixon would resort to \"measures of great consequence and force\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=597}} Hồ's reply letter, which Nixon received on 30 August 1969, welcomed peace talks with the U.S. to look for a way to end the war but made no concessions, as Nixon's threats made no impression on him. {{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=597}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Hochiminh and Bebet.JPG|thumb|left|Hồ Chí Minh holding his god-daughter, baby Elizabeth (Babette) Aubrac, with Elizabeth's mother, [[Lucie Aubrac|Lucie]], 1946]]\nIn addition to being a politician, Hồ Chí Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/ho-chi-minh-prison-diary/|title=Ho Chi Minh: From 'Prison Diary'|first=Ho Chi|last=Minh|date=7 May 1968|magazine=The Nation}}</ref> and [[Multilingualism|polyglot]].

During [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign|North Vietnam's final campaign]] in 1975, a famous song written by composer {{ill|Huy Thuc|vi|Huy Thục}} was often sung by PAVN soldiers: \"{{lang|vi|Bác vẫn cùng chúng cháu hành quân}}\" (\"You are still marching with us, Uncle Hồ\"). {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[Fall of Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, several PAVN tanks displayed a poster with those same words on it.

It is comparable to that of Mao Zedong in China and of [[Kim Il Sung]] and [[Kim Jong Il]] in North Korea. Although Hồ Chí Minh wished for his body to be cremated and his ashes spread to North, Central, and South Vietnam, the body instead is embalmed on view in a [[Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum|mausoleum]].

As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Hồ Chí Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule [[Cochinchina]]) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".{{sfn|Duiker|1982|p=25}}\n\n[[File:TTHCM.JPG|thumb|left|Shrine devoted to Hồ Chí Minh]]\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of Confucianism, condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism, and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the Bảo Đại) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (''Gia Truong'').

Today, Hồ Chí Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums. The first such medium was one Madam Lang in the 1990s, but the cult acquired a significant number of followers through another medium, Madam Xoan. She established on 1 January 2001 Đạo Ngọc Phật Hồ Chí Minh (the Way of Hồ Chí Minh as the Jade Buddha) also known as Đạo Bác Hồ (the Way of Uncle Hồ) at đền Hòa Bình (the Peace Temple) in Chí Linh-Sao Đỏ district of [[Hải Dương]] province.
